    <p>
      Play with your own pictures as jigsaw puzzles. It's very easy to use, simple to play, and it's a lot of fun! Adjust the size and difficulty of the puzzle. The goal is to assemble the selected picture by dragging the matching pieces to each other. Rotate any piece with a multitouch gesture. Matching pieces will snap together when you move them close enough.
